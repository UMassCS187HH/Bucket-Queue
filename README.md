### Definition of a Bucket Queue

From Wikipedia:
> A bucket queue (also called a bucket priority queue or bounded-height priority queue) is a priority queue for prioritizing elements whose priorities are small integers. It has the form of an array of buckets: an array data structure, indexed by the priorities, whose cells contain buckets of items with the same priority as each other.
